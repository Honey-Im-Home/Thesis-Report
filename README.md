# Sustainable Precision Agriculture: An Autonomous Approach to Soil Sensing and Sapling Tree Management

## 📄 Project Overview
This research introduces an AI-driven, autonomous agricultural robot designed for sustainable and precision farming. The system integrates machine learning (YOLOv11), soil sensor technologies, and robotics (Arduino & Raspberry Pi) to monitor soil health and detect plant diseases in real-time. The goal is to enable informed, automated interventions that improve sapling tree management, crop productivity, and environmental sustainability.

## 🧠 Key Technologies
- **Machine Learning:** YOLOv11, CNNs, Deep Learning
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5, Arduino Uno, IR Sensors, Servo Motors
- **Soil Sensors:** 7-in-1 sensor (pH, EC, humidity, temperature, NPK)
- **Software Tools:** Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics, Excel for Data Logging
- **Navigation:** IR-based line following, obstacle detection

## 🚀 System Features
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Robot follows pre-defined paths and stops at designated soil sampling points.
- **Soil Monitoring:** Real-time data acquisition for pH, EC, humidity, temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Plant Disease Detection:** Uses YOLOv11 for identifying Scab, Rust, Multiple Disease, and Healthy leaves.
- **Health Scoring:** Plant health is quantified using a custom scoring algorithm.
- **Data Logging & Alerts:** Results are stored in Excel with thresholds triggering automated warnings.

## 📊 Outcomes
- Achieved high detection accuracy for plant diseases like Scab and Rust.
- Effective computation of Soil Damage Levels (SDL) before and after fertilizer application.
- Real-world deployment showed actionable insights for rose, guava, and tomato sapling treatment.
- Fertilizer usage led to improved soil quality and reduced SDL values.

## 🔍 Highlights
- Real-time feedback for farmers and agronomists
- Integrated sensor-vision system for autonomous agri-robotics
- Cost-effective, scalable solution for developing country agriculture
- Emphasis on sustainability and smart farming practices

## 📈 Future Enhancements
